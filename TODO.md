- the header could be a lot nicer
- some images are missing alt text, or have undecriptive names/alt text (for SEO)
- we should probably remove shitty pictures (quality over quantity)
- gallery would be nice if it was full width on big screens
- the form needs a description
  - not sure what this means exactly
- cta's kinda suck ("interested?")
- use webp for the images
  - or png8

- layout idea:
  - basically a full page gallery that scrolls, and a sidebar that has business info and a contact form
